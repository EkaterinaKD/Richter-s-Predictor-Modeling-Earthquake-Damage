# Richter-s-Predictor-Modeling-Earthquake-Damage
Code for a tutorial project to determine the optimal machine learning model for predicting damage after an earthquake
This project provides the code for a machine learning study project. In this project, the prediction accuracy of 4 machine learning models is estimated and, based on this data, a model is selected for further work.
